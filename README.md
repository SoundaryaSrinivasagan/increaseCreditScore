# Increase Credit Score
## <ins> Introduction

The `Increase Credit Score` tool was designed by me as a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) project to help users manage their credit spending 
and re-payment structure to effectively increase their credit score in the long run. The tool consists of two major components:
**Spending Limit** and **General Re-Payment Date**. The Spending Limit feature would take all the credit products that the user currently has and 
calculate a 30% limit that the user is recommended to use to effectively improve their credit in the long run. For example, if you have
a $1000 credit limit with the National Bank of Canada, you are recommended by *Transunion/Equifax/Government of Canada* to spend $300 of it a month.
Moreover, the General Re-Payment Date feature would take information on when the statement generates for each credit product and compute
a general day based on a 15-day grace period that the user can pay off their full balance or atleast make minimum payments. This would allow the user
to remember 1-2 days every month instead of multiple days based off their credit products.

__Targeted User:__ The product will be really useful for people with low to no credit or people that just want to increase their score in general.
The two major features of this product would one allow the user to condition themselves a new spending limit based on the 
recommended 30% limit in each credit product and two have a general day in each month that they user should remember to pay 
off statement balances for all their credit products.
